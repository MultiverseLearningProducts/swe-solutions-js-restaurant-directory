# Restaurant directory

Let's use our restaurant API to create a front end!

1. With [semantic HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML) in mind, let's start writing the markup for our front end. You can use the [HTML element reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) to help you choose the most semantic elements.
2. Can you start adding some CSS to style your HTML? You can design it however you want! You might find these references helpful: [CSS selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors) and [CSS properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Properties_Reference).
